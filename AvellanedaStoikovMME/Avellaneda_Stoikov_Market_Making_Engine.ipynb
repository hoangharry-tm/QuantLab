    "Section 1: Executive Summary & Theoretical FrameworkPurpose: Prove you understand the why before the how.Content: * A brief overview of the Avellaneda-Stoikov (AS) model.Definitions of key variables: $s$ (mid-price), $q$ (inventory), $\\sigma$ (volatility), $\\gamma$ (risk aversion), and $k$ (liquidity decay).Scientific Formulae: Render the Indifference Price and Optimal Spread equations using LaTeX.Resume Tip: State clearly that this model balances Inventory Risk against Execution Risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 2: Environment Setup & Data EngineeringPurpose: Show you can handle real-world financial data.Content:Imports: yfinance, numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib.Data Acquisition: Fetch 1-minute data for a high-beta stock (e.g., NVDA).Feature Engineering: Calculate log returns and \"Tick-level Simulation.\" Since yfinance lacks ticks, you will simulate 10–20 \"sub-minute\" trades per bar to create a synthetic high-frequency environment.Technical Depth: Discuss the limitations of 1-minute bars and why high-frequency data is preferred for this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 3: Statistical Calibration (The MLE Engine)Purpose: This is the most \"Quant\" section. It demonstrates your ability to fit models to data.Content:Define the likelihood function for order arrivals: $\\lambda(\\delta) = A e^{-k\\delta}$.MLE Implementation: Use scipy.optimize.minimize to find the $A$ and $k$ parameters.The MLE Report: A plot showing the empirical probability of a trade versus your fitted exponential curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 4: Volatility Dynamics & Risk ParametersPurpose: Defining the \"Market State.\"Content:Calculate a rolling 20-period standard deviation of price changes.Define $\\gamma$ (Risk Aversion). Create a \"Sensitivity Analysis\" section where you explain how changing $\\gamma$ shifts the strategy from \"Aggressive\" to \"Defensive.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 5: The Avellaneda-Stoikov Logic ClassPurpose: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is vital for software engineering roles.Content:Create a class MarketMakingEngine.Methods: calculate_reservation_price(), calculate_optimal_spread(), and update_inventory().This keeps your logic clean and modular—exactly what recruiters want to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 6: The Event-Driven BacktesterPurpose: Simulation of a live trading environment.Content:A loop that iterates through every \"tick.\"Matching Engine: Logic that checks: If (Market Buy Price > My Ask) -> Sold 1 unit.Inventory Constraints: Implement a \"Hard Limit\" (e.g., if $q > 100$, stop buying).\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 7: Performance Analytics & P&L AttributionPurpose: Proving the model works.Content:Equity Curve: Plot total P&L over time.Inventory Plot: Visualize how your position fluctuates around zero.P&L Attribution: Decompose profit into \"Spread Capture\" (good) vs. \"Inventory P&L\" (directional risk).Risk Metrics: Calculate the Sharpe Ratio and Maximum Drawdown.\n",

    "Section 8: Conclusion & Future ResearchPurpose: Demonstrates intellectual\n",
    "curiosity and critical thinking.Content:Summary of findings (e.g., \"The AS model\n",
    "reduced inventory variance by 40% compared to a naive strategy\").Adverse\n",
    "Selection: Discuss how \"Toxic Flow\" affects your results.Future Steps: Mention\n",

    "discuss:Constant Volatility ($\\sigma$): The model assumes $\\sigma$ is constant.\n",
    "In reality, volatility is stochastic and clusters (GARCH effects).Symmetric\n",
    "Order Arrivals: The model assumes buy and sell orders arrive with the same\n",
    "intensity. In trending markets, the book becomes \"lopsided\" (order flow\n",
    "toxicity).No Market Impact: It assumes your limit orders don't move the market.\n",
    "In reality, large quotes can \"scare\" other participants (signaling\n",
    "risk).Independence of Mid-Price: It assumes the mid-price is a pure random walk,\n",
    "ignoring the \"Information Effect\" where trades themselves move the price.\n",
