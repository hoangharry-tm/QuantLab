    "# Optimal Market Making with Avellaneda-Stoikov Inventory Control\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "___Abstract:___ This project implements the Avellaneda-Stoikov framework for optimal market making in a high-volume equity environment. The objective is to manage the fundamental trade-off between spread capture and inventory risk by using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to calibrate order-arrival intensities and applying stochastic control theory. The engine dynamically adjusts bid-ask quotes relative to a calculated indifference price.\n",
    "\n",
    "___Key Learnings:___ Throughout this project, I developed a deep understanding of market microstructure, specifically how liquidity decay ($k$) and risk aversion ($\\gamma$) dictate optimal quoting behavior. I also gained proficiency in event-driven backtesting and quantitative P&L attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "___Discoveries:___ The simulation results demonstrate that the Avellaneda-Stoikov strategy significantly reduces inventory variance compared to the symmetric \"naive\" quoting. The model successfully mitigates Adverse Selection by shading quotes as inventory accumulates, resulting in a more stable Sharpe Ratio in volatile market regimes.\n",

    "\n",
    "In their paper published in 2006 [1], they mentioned two main concerns for market makers, which are quoted \n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"(i) The agent faces an __inventory risk__ due to the diffusive nature of the stock's mid-price and (ii) a __transactions risk__ due to a Poisson arrival of market buy and sell orders.\"*, \n",

    "and suggested a two-step procedure to tackle these. However, before we move to further complex maths, let us take a step back and understand the problem. A good way to understand it is to consider the following analogy. Imagine you run a grocery store that buys and sells apples, and you post these two prices on your board: \"We buy apples at $\\$0.98$,\" and \"We sell apples at $\\$1.02$.\" The gap between the two prices, or bid-ask spread, is your profit. Then, you see, you want the gap to be as wide as possible so that you can earn more, but by lowering the buying price and increasing the selling price, no one will buy or sell you apples. On a contrary, if the spread is thin, there is a chance that a more professional wholesaler, who has better information than you, will only trade with you when they know the town price is about to move — selling you apples right before prices fall or buying from you right before prices rise. That's adverse selection. In other words, they are using your store as a convenient place to unload their risk and lock in profit at your expense. Okay, so that is market making, at least that is to my understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we consider a few problems of market making, mentioned by Avellaneda and Stoikov:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inventory risk.** Suppose that one day, several farmers are showing up in the town, selling you apples, and you decide to restock 5,000 of them. However, the news soon spreads that there has just been a new wave of apple supply to the town. So, the fair price drops from $\\$1.00$ to $\\$0.90$. There you go, the more inventory that you have, the more exposed you are to the fluctuation of the market.\n",
    "2. **Transactions risk.** Well, since you cannot control the flow of customers or farmers (i.e., the demand and supply), at some point, either you suddenly have more apples than you should have, or you are short of stock. Because of this randomness, even if prices never changed, unpredictable order arrivals can push you into dangerous inventory imbalances.\n",
